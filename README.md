# 📊 Statistics for Data Analysis – Applied Probability & Distributions

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a collection of applied statistical analyses using Python,
focused on core concepts commonly required for data analysis roles.

Through practical examples, the project demonstrates how statistical theory can be
translated into real-world problem solving using probability distributions and
measures of variability.
